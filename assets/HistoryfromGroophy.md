# **alpha beta**

>The alpha-beta process, which is the beginning of this adventure that I started on the 9th of the 6th month in 2021, means a lot to me.
>Batch IDE was named Cmd Debugger in alpha-beta, but it changed **over time**. I learned a lot while developing this project.
>**But I believe I can do more.** So I went ahead and developed more.

>Thanks to a problem on 18.10.2021, I took a better path. visuality.
>Cmd Debugger was so ugly, wasn't it? **That's why I put aside my effort of about 4 months(+600 lines code)** and started a new project.

# **Beta**
---
>The date is 07.11.2021 I am at the beginning of the second part of the adventure. After starting my project from the beginning, I spent a while trying to find modern tools to focus on modernity.
>With the advice of kvc and anic17, **I wrote +2000 lines of code in about 1.5 months** and **something changed for the first time in this time. I didn't have enough time anymore.
>Since I didn't have enough time, I started to write code on paper at school, I saw it as more important than the lessons. When writing code, math is basic and code is college level.**
>I realized that my math teachers couldn't even help with things like algorithms. I started university subjects. **I've always wondered, I wonder if mathematics is in real life.
>what will it do for me? I got my answer very well.** My productivity had increased about **13** times. I cared about my sleep pattern, I used to get up at 8 every morning and just write code for hours.
>After 1.5 months, I couldn't sleep at night, I went to the living room and thought why is it so bad? **This is not my potential. From 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock I just thought.**
>I opened a new project and started researching to ask more and understand the inside.

>Definitely not my math teacher. I think I pushed myself so hard that after a while I started to enjoy learning even from the hard stuff.
