You can view sample data to see what information is sent, and you may opt out of sending the anonymized usage data.</p>
<p>This Software is provided &quot;as-is&quot; with no warranties, and you agree that Groophy is not liable for anything you do with it.</p>
<p>You really ought to just go ahead and read the whole EULA. It&apos;s not all that long. You should not only rely on this summary.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><strong>The License</strong></p>
<p>This EULA entitles you to install as many copies of the Software as you want, and use the Software for any lawful purpose consistent with this EULA. Your license to use the Software is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to all of the terms of this EULA. This software is licensed, not sold.

<br>
<p><strong>Privacy Notices</strong></p>
<p>The Software automatically communicates with its server for three purposes: (1) updating the Software; (2) sending error reports; and (3) sending anonymized usage data so we may improve the Software. If you would like to learn more about the specific information we send, please visit www.groophy-inc.github.io/privacy. You may opt out of sending the anonymized usage data, but if you do not want the Software to update automatically or send error reports, you must uninstall the Software.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Automatic Software Updates. The Software communicates with its server (and sends information described at the URL above) to determine whether there are any patches, bug fixes, updates, upgrades or other modifications to improve the Software. You agree that the Software may automatically install any such improvements to the Software on your computer without providing any further notice or receiving any additional consent. This feature may not be disabled. If you do not want to receive automatic updates, you must uninstall the Software.</p>
<p>Error Reports. In order to help us improve the Software, when the Software encounters certain errors, it will automatically send some information to its server about the error (as described at the URL above). This feature may not be disabled. If you do not want to send error reports to its server, you must uninstall the Software.</p>
<p>Anonymized Usage Data. Batch IDE collects anonymized data about your usage of the Software to help us make it more awesome. Approximately once a day the Software sends such data (as described in more detail at the URL above) to its server.

To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open-Source Components prohibit any of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Open-Source Component, such restrictions will not apply to such Open-Source Component. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open-Source Components require Licensor to make an offer to provide source code in connection with the Product, such offer is hereby made, and you may exercise it by contacting groophyinc@outlook.com.</p>
